I asked ChatGPT to teach me Python because I want to learn the basic of computer programming. This is the workbook that, over time, ChatGPT took me through.

ChatGPT prompt:

"You are an experienced coding teacher. You will comprehensively teach me Python, starting from an absolute beginner level."

# Lesson 1: Introduction to Python

**What is Python?**

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.

**Setting Up Python:**

1. Install Python: Go to the Python website and download the latest version for your operating system.
2. Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IDLE or Visual Studio Code for a more user-friendly coding experience.

**Your First Python Program:**

Let's write a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python:

print("Hello, World!")

**Understanding the Code:**

- print() is a built-in function that displays text in the console.
- "Hello, World!" is a string, enclosed in double quotes.

**Running Your Program:**

1. Open your IDE.
2. Type the code above.
3. Save the file with a .py extension (e.g., hello.py).
4. Run the program.

You should see "Hello, World!" displayed in the console. Congratulations, you've written your first Python program!

# Lesson 2: Variables and Data Types

In Python, variables are used to store data. Data comes in different types, and Python provides several built-in data types. Here are some of the basic data types:

1. Integers (int): Whole numbers without a decimal point.

my_integer = 42

2. Floating-Point Numbers (float): Numbers with a decimal point.

my_float = 3.14

3. Strings (str): Textual data enclosed in single or double quotes.

my_string = "Hello, Python!"

4. Booleans (bool): Represents either True or False.

my_bool = True

**Creating Variables:**

You can create variables by assigning values to them using the equal sign (=).

Example:

name = "Alice"
age = 30
height = 5.8
is_student = True

**Printing Variables:**

You can use the print() function to display the values of variables:

print(name)
print(age)

**Concatenating Strings:**

To combine strings, you can use the + operator:

first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)

**Practice Exercise:

1. Create variables to store your name, age, and a sentence about yourself. Then, print these variables to the console.

##########

# Lesson 3: Control Structures

**Conditional Statements (if, elif, else):**

Conditional statements allow your program to make decisions based on conditions. Here's how they work:

age = 18

if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif age == 18:
    print("You are just 18 years old.")
else:
    print("You are an adult.")

- if: Checks a condition and executes the code block if the condition is True.
- elif (short for "else if"): Allows you to check additional conditions if the first one is False.
- else: Provides a default action if none of the previous conditions are True.

**Loops (for and while):**

Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times.

for Loop:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

This loop iterates through the list fruits and prints each item.

while Loop:

count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

This loop continues as long as the condition (count < 5) is True.

**Functions:**

Functions are reusable blocks of code. They make your code more organized and easier to maintain.

def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
    
greet("Alice")

This defines a function greet that takes a parameter name and prints a greeting.

**Practice Exercise:**

1. Write a program that asks the user for their age and tells them whether they are a child, teenager, or adult.
2. Use a loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10.
3. Create a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.

##########

# Lesson 5: Dictionaries in Python

**Dictionaries:**

Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. Unlike lists, which use numeric indices, dictionaries use keys to access their values. Keys are unique within a dictionary.

**Creating Dictionaries:**

* Creating an empty dictionary
my_dict = {}

* Creating a dictionary with key-value pairs
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

**Accessing Values:**

You can access values in a dictionary by using their keys:

print(person["name"])  # Prints "Alice"
print(person["age"])   # Prints 30

**Modifying Dictionaries:**

You can change the values associated with keys:

person["age"] = 31  # Updates the age to 31
person["city"] = "San Francisco"  # Updates the city

**Adding New Key-Value Pairs:**

You can add new key-value pairs to a dictionary:

person["job"] = "Engineer"  # Adds a new key "job" with the value "Engineer"

**Dictionary Operations:**

You can check if a key exists in a dictionary, get a list of keys, and get a list of values:

if "name" in person:
    print("Name exists in the dictionary")

keys = person.keys()  # Returns a list of keys
values = person.values()  # Returns a list of values

**Iterating Through Dictionaries:**

You can loop through the keys or key-value pairs of a dictionary using a for loop:

for key in person:
    print(key, person[key])  # Prints key and value
    
* Alternatively, use items() to loop through key-value pairs directly
for key, value in person.items():
    print(key, value)

**Practice Exercise:**

1. Create a dictionary to store information about a book. Include keys like "title," "author," and "year."
2. Update the book's year and add a new key for "genre."
3. Print all the keys and values of the book dictionary using a for loop.

# Lesson 6: Functions and More

**Functions (Continued):**

In our previous lesson, we learned how to create functions and return values from them. Now, let's explore more about functions:

**Default Parameters:**

You can specify default values for function parameters. If a value is not provided when calling the function, the default value is used.

def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    print(greeting + ", " + name + "!")

**Keyword Arguments:**

You can use keyword arguments to specify the parameter names when calling a function.

greet(greeting="Hi", name="Alice")

**2. Lists (Continued):**

Lists are incredibly versatile. Let's explore some more list operations:

**List Comprehensions:**

List comprehensions allow you to create lists in a concise way.

squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]

**List Methods:**

Explore methods like append(), remove(), pop(), sort(), and reverse() to manipulate lists.

**3. Control Structures (Continued):**

Let's take control structures to the next level:

**Nested Loops:**

You can use nested loops to iterate through multiple levels of data.

for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
        print(i, j)

**Conditional Expressions (Ternary Operator):**

The ternary operator allows you to write concise conditional statements in a single line.

result = "Even" if num % 2 == 0 else "Odd"

**4. Error Handling:**

Learn about error handling with try, except, else, and finally. It's crucial for robust programs.

try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
else:
    print("No error occurred.")
finally:
    print("This runs no matter what.")

**Practice Exercises:**

1. Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
2. Write a program that generates a list of prime numbers within a specified range.
3. Implement a nested loop to print a multiplication table (e.g., 2x2, 2x3, ...).

**Needed additional support from ChatGPT**

Function: A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. In this case, you'll create a function.

Factorial: The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. For example, 5! (read as "five factorial") is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, which equals 120.

Recursion: Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself to solve a problem. In this case, you'll create a function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion, meaning the function will call itself to find the factorial.

Here's a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion:

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1  # Base case: 0! is 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

Let's understand how this works:

The factorial function takes one argument, n, which is the number for which we want to calculate the factorial.

In the function, there is a base case: when n equals 0, the function returns 1. This is necessary because 0! is defined as 1.

If n is not 0, the function recursively calls itself with n - 1 and multiplies the result by n.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:

result = factorial(5)  # Calculates 5!
print("Factorial of 5 is:", result)

The function will calculate 5! using recursion, and you'll get the result 120. You can replace 5 with any non-negative integer to calculate its factorial.

Generating a list of prime numbers within a specified range can be a bit more involved, but I'll guide you through the process step by step. Here's one way to do it in Python:

Prime Numbers: Prime numbers are positive integers greater than 1 that are divisible only by 1 and themselves (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...).

Algorithm to Generate Prime Numbers:

1. Start with an empty list to store prime numbers.
2. For each number n in the specified range:
3. Check if n is greater than 1 (prime numbers must be greater than 1).
4. For each number i from 2 to the square root of n:
5. If n is divisible by i, it's not prime. Move to the next number.
6. If no i divides n, add n to the list of prime numbers.
7. After checking all numbers in the range, the list will contain prime numbers.

Here's a Python program that implements this algorithm:

import math

def generate_primes_in_range(start, end):
    prime_numbers = []

    for num in range(start, end + 1):
        if num > 1:  # Prime numbers must be greater than 1
            is_prime = True
            for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1):
                if num % i == 0:
                    is_prime = False
                    break
            if is_prime:
                prime_numbers.append(num)

    return prime_numbers

* Define the range for prime numbers
start_range = 10
end_range = 50

* Generate and print prime numbers in the specified range
prime_list = generate_primes_in_range(start_range, end_range)
print("Prime numbers in the range", start_range, "to", end_range, "are:", prime_list)

This program defines a function generate_primes_in_range that takes a start and end value and returns a list of prime numbers within that range. You can adjust the start_range and end_range variables to specify the range you want to search for prime numbers in.

Printing a multiplication table means displaying the results of multiplying numbers within a specified range. In this case, we want to implement a nested loop to print a multiplication table.

Nested Loop: A nested loop is a loop inside another loop. In this context, we'll use two loops, one nested inside the other, to create the multiplication table.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to implement a nested loop to print a multiplication table in Python:

1. Decide the range for which you want to generate the multiplication table. For example, if you want to create a table for the numbers from 2 to 5, you'll loop through these numbers.
2. Use two loops. The outer loop (let's call it the "row" loop) will iterate through the first number (2, 3, 4, etc.), and the inner loop (the "column" loop) will iterate through the second number (2, 3, 4, etc.).
3. Inside the inner loop, calculate the product of the current row and column numbers and print the result. This will generate the multiplication table.

Here's Python code that accomplishes this:

* Define the range for the multiplication table
start_num = 2
end_num = 5

* Nested loop to create the multiplication table
for i in range(start_num, end_num + 1):
    for j in range(start_num, end_num + 1):
        result = i * j
        print(i, "x", j, "=", result)

In this code:

1. The outer loop (for i in range(start_num, end_num + 1)) iterates through the first number in the range (2 to 5).
2. The inner loop (for j in range(start_num, end_num + 1)) iterates through the second number in the range (also 2 to 5).
3. Inside the inner loop, we calculate the product i * j and print it as part of the multiplication table.

When you run this code, it will print a multiplication table for the specified range, showing results like "2x2 = 4", "2x3 = 6", and so on.

I'll provide more thorough explanations in future lessons to ensure you have a better understanding of the concepts before moving on to practice sections. Let's proceed with the next lesson.

# Lesson 7: Python Control Flow

In this lesson, we'll dive deeper into control flow in Python. Control flow is how you manage the execution of your program based on conditions, loops, and more.

**1. Conditional Statements (if, elif, else):**

Conditional statements allow you to make decisions in your code.

age = 20

if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif age == 18:
    print("You just turned 18.")
else:
    print("You are an adult.")

- if: Checks a condition and executes a code block if the condition is true.
- elif (short for "else if"): Allows you to check additional conditions if the first one is false.
- else: Provides a default action if none of the previous conditions are true.

**2. Loops (for, while):**

Loops allow you to repeat code.

- 'for' Loop:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

- 'while' Loop:

count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

**3. List Comprehensions:**

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.

squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]

**4. Error Handling (try, except, finally):**

Error handling helps you manage exceptions in your code.

try:
    result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
finally:
    print("This runs no matter what.")

**5. More on Functions:**

Functions allow you to encapsulate code into reusable blocks.

- Default parameters: You can specify default values for function parameters.
- Keyword arguments: You can use keyword arguments when calling functions.

**6. More on Dictionaries:**

Dictionaries store key-value pairs.

- Access values by keys.
- Modify values.
- Add new key-value pairs.

**7. More on Lists:**

Lists are versatile data structures.

- List methods (e.g., append(), remove()).
- Slicing lists.
- Iterating through lists with 'for' loops.

**8. Control Flow Practice:**

We'll practice concepts like conditional statements, loops, and error handling to solidify your understanding.

Let's focus on each of these concepts one by one, starting with conditional statements.

# Concept 1: Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)

Conditional statements in Python allow you to make decisions in your code based on conditions. They are a fundamental part of programming. Let's dive deeper into conditional statements.

**Conditional Statements:**

Conditional statements are used to execute different code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false.

In Python, the most common conditional statements are:

- if: Executes a block of code if a condition is true.
- elif (short for "else if"): Allows you to check additional conditions if the previous ones are false.
- else: Provides a default action if none of the previous conditions are true.

**Practice Exercise:**

Let's practice by writing code that categorizes a given temperature into different levels: "cold," "moderate," or "hot," based on the following rules:

- If the temperature is below 0 degrees Celsius, it's "cold."
- If the temperature is between 0 and 25 degrees Celsius (inclusive), it's "moderate."
- If the temperature is above 25 degrees Celsius, it's "hot."

Write Python code that takes a temperature as input and prints the corresponding category.
