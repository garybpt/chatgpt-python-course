# Lesson 1: Getting Started with Python

Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its readability and simplicity. In this lesson, we'll cover the basics to get you started.

**1.1 Introduction to Python:**

- Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language.
- It's known for its readability, which makes it an excellent choice for beginners.

**1.2 Setting up the Python Environment:**

There are several ways to run Python code:

- Python Interpreter: You can run Python code interactively in a terminal by typing python or python3 (depending on your installation) and entering Python commands.
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): You can use IDEs like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Jupyter Notebook for a more comprehensive development environment.
- For beginners, using an IDE is often more comfortable, as it provides code highlighting, debugging tools, and better code organization.

**1.3 Writing Your First Python Program (Hello World):**

Let's start by writing your first Python program, the classic "Hello, World!" program.

```# This is a Python comment. Comments are ignored by the interpreter.
print("Hello, World!")  # This line prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
```

- Save the above code in a file with a .py extension (e.g., hello.py).
- Run it using the Python interpreter or your chosen IDE.
- You should see "Hello, World!" printed on the screen.

**1.4 Variables and Data Types:**

- In Python, you can store data in variables.
- Common data types include:
- Integers (int): Whole numbers like 1, 2, -3, etc.
- Floats (float): Decimal numbers like 3.14, -0.5, etc.
- Strings (str): Text enclosed in single (' ') or double (" ") quotes, like "Hello, Python!"
- Booleans (bool): True or False values.

**1.5 Basic Input and Output:**

- You can interact with users by taking input and displaying output.
- The input() function reads input from the user.
- The print() function displays output on the screen.

**Exercise 1:**

Let's create a simple program together. We'll ask the user for their name and then greet them.

```# Ask the user for their name
name = input("What's your name? ")

# Greet the user
print("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to Python.")
```

- Copy and paste the code into a .py file.
- Run the program.
- Enter your name when prompted.

Congratulations! You've completed Lesson 1 and created your first Python program. You now have a basic understanding of Python syntax, variables, data types, input/output, and running Python code.

# Lesson 2: Control Structures

In this lesson, we'll explore control structures in Python, including conditional statements and loops.

**2.1 Conditional Statements:**

Conditional statements allow your program to make decisions. The primary constructs are if, elif (short for "else if"), and else.

**Exercise 2:**

Write a Python program that does the following:

- Asks the user for their age.
- If the age is 18 or older, print "You are eligible to vote."
- If the age is less than 18, print "You are not eligible to vote."

**2.2 Loops:**

Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. Python has two main types of loops: for and while.

**Exercise 2 (continued):**

Now, modify your program to do the following:

- Ask the user how many times they'd like to see the eligibility message.
- Use a for loop to display the eligibility message that many times.

##########

# Lesson 3: Functions and Modules

In this lesson, we'll explore functions and modules in Python.

**3.1 Functions:**

Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They help you break down your program into smaller, manageable parts. Functions are defined using the def keyword.

**Exercise 3:**

Create a Python function called calculate_sum that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. Then, use this function to calculate the sum of two numbers entered by the user.

**3.2 Modules:**

Modules are Python files containing reusable code, including functions, variables, and classes. You can import modules into your programs to use their functionality.

**Exercise 3 (continued):**

Create a separate Python file named math_operations.py and define the calculate_sum function in it. Then, in your main program file, import the calculate_sum function from math_operations.py and use it to calculate the sum of two numbers.

##########

# Lesson 4: Lists and Tuples

In this lesson, we'll explore lists and tuples, two fundamental data structures in Python.

**4.1 Lists:**

- Lists are ordered collections of items.
- They can contain elements of different data types (integers, strings, etc.).
- Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their contents.

**Exercise 4:**

Create an empty list called my_list. Then, add the following elements to it:

- "apple"
- 42 (an integer)
- 3.14 (a float)
- "banana"

Print the my_list to see the result.

**4.2 Tuples:**

Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation.

**Exercise 4 (continued):**

Create a tuple called my_tuple with the same elements as my_list. Then, try to change one of the elements in the tuple to see what happens.

**4.3 List Comprehensions:**

- List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.
- They are often used for filtering and transforming data.

**Exercise 4 (continued):**

Create a list called numbers containing the numbers from 1 to 10. Then, use a list comprehension to create a new list called squared_numbers that contains the squares of these numbers.

#Â Lesson 5: Dictionaries and Sets

In this lesson, we'll explore dictionaries and sets, two more essential data structures in Python.

**5.1 Dictionaries:**

- Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs.
- They are unordered and mutable.
- Dictionaries are commonly used to store and retrieve data based on keys.

**Exercise 5:**

Create a dictionary called student_scores to store the scores of three students. Use their names as keys and assign scores as values. For example: "Alice": 90, "Bob": 85, "Charlie": 78.

**5.2 Sets:**

- Sets are collections of unique elements.
- They are unordered and mutable.
- Sets are useful for performing operations like union, intersection, and difference.

You have two sets, set1 and set2, and we'll perform the following set operations:

1. Union:

- The union of two sets, denoted as set1 | set2, contains all unique elements from both sets.
- In other words, it combines the elements of both sets while removing duplicates.

Example:

```set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

union_result = set1 | set2  # Union of set1 and set2
print(union_result)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
```


2. Intersection:

- The intersection of two sets, denoted as set1 & set2, contains only the elements that are common to both sets.
- It selects elements that exist in both sets.

Example:

```set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

intersection_result = set1 & set2  # Intersection of set1 and set2
print(intersection_result)  # Output: {3, 4}
```

3. Difference (Unique Elements in set1):

- To find the elements that are unique to set1 (not in set2), you can use the difference operation, denoted as set1 - set2.

Example:

```set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

difference_result = set1 - set2  # Unique elements in set1
print(difference_result)  # Output: {1, 2}
```

These set operations can be useful for various tasks, such as filtering data, finding common elements, or identifying unique items between two sets.

**Exercise 5 (continued):**

Create two sets, set1 and set2, containing some common elements and some unique elements. Then, perform the following set operations:

- Find the union of set1 and set2.
- Find the intersection of set1 and set2.
- Find the elements that are unique to set1 (not in set2).

# Lesson 6: File Handling

In this lesson, we'll explore file handling in Python, including reading and writing text files.

**Opening a File:**

- You can open a file using the open() function, which takes two arguments: the filename and the mode (e.g., 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, 'a' for appending).

```Example: file = open("filename.txt", "r")```

**Exercise 6:**

Create a text file named sample.txt and write some text into it. Then, write a Python program that opens and reads the contents of sample.txt and prints them to the console.

**Reading from a File:**

- To read the entire contents of a file as a string, you can use the read() method.
- To read one line at a time, you can use the readline() method.
- To read all lines into a list, you can use the readlines() method.

**Writing to a File:**

- To write to a file, you can open it in write mode ('w') or append mode ('a').
- Use the write() method to write data to the file.

**Closing a File:**

- After reading or writing to a file, it's essential to close it using the close() method.
- Alternatively, you can use a with statement as a context manager to ensure the file is automatically closed when you're done.

**Exercise 6 (continued):**

Modify your program to create a new text file named output.txt and write a message of your choice into it.

**Example: Reading from a File (without context manager):**

```file = open("sample.txt", "r")  # Open the file in read mode
contents = file.read()  # Read the entire file as a string
file.close()  # Close the file
```

**Example: Writing to a File (without context manager):**

```file = open("output.txt", "w")  # Open the file in write mode
file.write("Hello, File!")  # Write data to the file
file.close()  # Close the file
```

**Example: Using a Context Manager (with statement):**

```# Using a context manager ensures the file is closed automatically.
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    contents = file.read()  # Read the entire file as a string
```

**The file is automatically closed when the 'with' block exits.**

Important Tips:

- Always close files after reading or writing to them to release system resources.
- When writing to a file in write mode ('w'), it will create a new file or overwrite the existing one with the same name.
- When opening a file in append mode ('a'), it will create a new file or append to an existing one without overwriting.
- Remember to replace "sample.txt" and "output.txt" with your actual filenames in the examples above.

**Exercise 6 (continued):**

Refactor your file reading and writing code to use the with statement for proper file handling.

# Lesson 7: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

In this lesson, we'll explore the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.

**7.1 Classes and Objects:**

Classes: Classes are the building blocks of OOP. They define the structure and behavior of objects. Classes have attributes (data) and methods (functions) that operate on that data.

Example:

```class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age, gender):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.gender = gender
    
    def print_details(self):
        print(f"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}, Gender: {self.gender}")
```
Objects: Objects are instances of classes. They represent specific instances of the data and behavior defined by the class.

Example:

```person1 = Person("Alice", 30, "Female")
person2 = Person("Bob", 25, "Male")

person1.print_details()  # Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30, Gender: Female
person2.print_details()  # Output: Name: Bob, Age: 25, Gender: Male
```

**Exercise 7:**

Create a class called Person with attributes such as name, age, and gender. Include a method to print the person's details.

**7.2 Inheritance:**

Inheritance: Inheritance allows you to create new classes based on existing classes. The new class (subclass) inherits attributes and methods from the existing class (base class).

Example:

```class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, gender, student_id):
        super().__init__(name, age, gender)
        self.student_id = student_id
    
    def print_details(self):
        super().print_details()
        print(f"Student ID: {self.student_id}")
```

**Exercise 7 (continued):**

Create a subclass called Student that inherits from the Person class. Add additional attributes and methods specific to students.

**7.3 Encapsulation:**

Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of making the internal representation of an object private and providing methods to interact with it. In Python, this is often achieved by using "getter" and "setter" methods.

Example:

```class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age, gender):
        self.name = name
        self.__age = age  # Private attribute
    
    def get_age(self):
        return self.__age
    
    def set_age(self, age):
        if age >= 0:
            self.__age = age
        else:
            print("Age cannot be negative.")
```

**Exercise 7 (continued):**

In the Person class, use encapsulation to make the age attribute private and provide a method to get and set the age.

**7.4 Polymorphism:**

Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This simplifies code and enhances flexibility.

Example:

```def print_person_details(person):
    person.print_details()

person = Person("Alice", 30, "Female")
student = Student("Bob", 25, "Male", "S12345")

print_person_details(person)  # Calls Person's print_details
print_person_details(student)  # Calls Student's print_details (polymorphism)
```

These concepts are fundamental to OOP in Python and can help you organize and structure your code effectively.

**Exercise 7 (continued):**

Demonstrate polymorphism by creating a function that takes a list of Person objects (including Student objects) and prints their details.
