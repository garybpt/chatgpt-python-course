**Lesson 3: Functions and Modules**

- Defining and calling functions.
- Function parameters and return values.
- Scope and global vs. local variables.
- Importing and using modules.

Exercise 3:

**Lesson 4: Lists and Tuples**

- Understanding lists and their methods.
- Working with tuples.
- List comprehensions.
- Slicing and indexing.

Exercise 4:

Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum, average, and the highest and lowest numbers in the list.

**Lesson 5: Dictionaries and Sets**

- Introduction to dictionaries and sets.
- Dictionary methods and operations.
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference).
- Iterating over dictionaries and sets.

Exercise 5:

Create a program that allows the user to create a dictionary of words and their meanings. Then, let the user search for the meaning of a word.

**Lesson 6: File Handling**

- Reading and writing text files.
- Using context managers (with statements).
- Handling exceptions (try, except, finally).
- Working with CSV files.

Exercise 6:

Write a program that reads data from a CSV file containing student names and their scores. Calculate the average score and display it.

**Lesson 7: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

- Understanding classes and objects.
- Defining class attributes and methods.
- Inheritance and polymorphism.
- Encapsulation and access control.

Exercise 7:

Create a class representing a basic bank account with methods for deposit and withdrawal. Test your class by creating instances of accounts and performing transactions.

**Lesson 8: Error Handling and Debugging**

- Common types of exceptions.
- Handling exceptions gracefully.
- Debugging techniques and tools (print statements, debugging libraries).
- Best practices for writing clean and maintainable code.

Exercise 8:

Write a program that includes intentional errors. Use exception handling to catch and handle these errors effectively.

**Lesson 9: Advanced Topics (Optional)**

- Generators and iterators.
- Decorators and function attributes.
- Lambda functions.
- List comprehensions revisited.

Exercise 9:

Choose one advanced topic and implement a small project or program that demonstrates its usage.

**Lesson 10: Libraries and Frameworks (Optional)**

- Introduction to popular Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas, matplotlib).
- Overview of web frameworks (e.g., Flask, Django).
- How to install and use external libraries.

Exercise 10:

Choose a library or framework of interest and follow a basic tutorial or create a simple project using it.

# Lesson 1: Getting Started with Python

Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its readability and simplicity. In this lesson, we'll cover the basics to get you started.

**1.1 Introduction to Python:**

- Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language.
- It's known for its readability, which makes it an excellent choice for beginners.

**1.2 Setting up the Python Environment:**

There are several ways to run Python code:

- Python Interpreter: You can run Python code interactively in a terminal by typing python or python3 (depending on your installation) and entering Python commands.
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): You can use IDEs like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Jupyter Notebook for a more comprehensive development environment.
- For beginners, using an IDE is often more comfortable, as it provides code highlighting, debugging tools, and better code organization.

**1.3 Writing Your First Python Program (Hello World):**

Let's start by writing your first Python program, the classic "Hello, World!" program.

```# This is a Python comment. Comments are ignored by the interpreter.
print("Hello, World!")  # This line prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
```

- Save the above code in a file with a .py extension (e.g., hello.py).
- Run it using the Python interpreter or your chosen IDE.
- You should see "Hello, World!" printed on the screen.

**1.4 Variables and Data Types:**

- In Python, you can store data in variables.
- Common data types include:
- Integers (int): Whole numbers like 1, 2, -3, etc.
- Floats (float): Decimal numbers like 3.14, -0.5, etc.
- Strings (str): Text enclosed in single (' ') or double (" ") quotes, like "Hello, Python!"
- Booleans (bool): True or False values.

**1.5 Basic Input and Output:**

- You can interact with users by taking input and displaying output.
- The input() function reads input from the user.
- The print() function displays output on the screen.

**Exercise 1:**

Let's create a simple program together. We'll ask the user for their name and then greet them.

```# Ask the user for their name
name = input("What's your name? ")

# Greet the user
print("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to Python.")
```

- Copy and paste the code into a .py file.
- Run the program.
- Enter your name when prompted.

Congratulations! You've completed Lesson 1 and created your first Python program. You now have a basic understanding of Python syntax, variables, data types, input/output, and running Python code.

# Lesson 2: Control Structures

In this lesson, we'll explore control structures in Python, including conditional statements and loops.

**2.1 Conditional Statements:**

Conditional statements allow your program to make decisions. The primary constructs are if, elif (short for "else if"), and else.

**Exercise 2:**

Write a Python program that does the following:

- Asks the user for their age.
- If the age is 18 or older, print "You are eligible to vote."
- If the age is less than 18, print "You are not eligible to vote."

**2.2 Loops:**

Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. Python has two main types of loops: for and while.

**Exercise 2 (continued):**

Now, modify your program to do the following:

- Ask the user how many times they'd like to see the eligibility message.
- Use a for loop to display the eligibility message that many times.
