Moving on to intermediate Python coding. ChatGPT prompt:

"You are an experienced coding teacher. You will comprehensively and thoroughly teach me Python at an intermediate level, with practice exercise for each lesson. First, I would like you to provide me with a lesson plan that we will follow."

# Lesson plan

**Lesson 1: Getting Started with Python**

- Introduction to Python and its popularity.
- Setting up the Python environment (interpreter, IDEs).
- Writing your first Python program (Hello World).
- Variables, data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans), and basic input/output.

Exercise 1:

Write a Python program that asks the user for their name and then prints a greeting using their name.

**Lesson 2: Control Structures**

- Conditional statements (if, elif, else).
- Logical operators (and, or, not).
- Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=).
- Loops (for, while) and control flow.

Exercise 2:

Write a Python program that asks the user for their age and then tells them if they are eligible to vote (18 and older).

**Lesson 3: Functions and Modules**

- Defining and calling functions.
- Function parameters and return values.
- Scope and global vs. local variables.
- Importing and using modules.

Exercise 3:

Create a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. Then, use this function to calculate the sum of two numbers entered by the user.

**Lesson 4: Lists and Tuples**

- Understanding lists and their methods.
- Working with tuples.
- List comprehensions.
- Slicing and indexing.

Exercise 4:

Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum, average, and the highest and lowest numbers in the list.

**Lesson 5: Dictionaries and Sets**

- Introduction to dictionaries and sets.
- Dictionary methods and operations.
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference).
- Iterating over dictionaries and sets.

Exercise 5:

Create a program that allows the user to create a dictionary of words and their meanings. Then, let the user search for the meaning of a word.

**Lesson 6: File Handling**

- Reading and writing text files.
- Using context managers (with statements).
- Handling exceptions (try, except, finally).
- Working with CSV files.

Exercise 6:

Write a program that reads data from a CSV file containing student names and their scores. Calculate the average score and display it.

**Lesson 7: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

- Understanding classes and objects.
- Defining class attributes and methods.
- Inheritance and polymorphism.
- Encapsulation and access control.

Exercise 7:

Create a class representing a basic bank account with methods for deposit and withdrawal. Test your class by creating instances of accounts and performing transactions.

**Lesson 8: Error Handling and Debugging**

- Common types of exceptions.
- Handling exceptions gracefully.
- Debugging techniques and tools (print statements, debugging libraries).
- Best practices for writing clean and maintainable code.

Exercise 8:

Write a program that includes intentional errors. Use exception handling to catch and handle these errors effectively.

**Lesson 9: Advanced Topics (Optional)**

- Generators and iterators.
- Decorators and function attributes.
- Lambda functions.
- List comprehensions revisited.

Exercise 9:

Choose one advanced topic and implement a small project or program that demonstrates its usage.

**Lesson 10: Libraries and Frameworks (Optional)**

- Introduction to popular Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas, matplotlib).
- Overview of web frameworks (e.g., Flask, Django).
- How to install and use external libraries.

Exercise 10:

Choose a library or framework of interest and follow a basic tutorial or create a simple project using it.
